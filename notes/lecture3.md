# self-attention, cnn, rnn, gnn, spatial transform layer and unsupervised learning



#### relation between cnn and self-attetion
![image](cnn-vs-attention.png)
* a paper introduce how to transfer a transformer to cnn [*on the relationship between self-attention and convolutional layers*](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.03584)
* cnn is a subset of attention, attention is more flexible, and easy to overfit. This means attention need more data, to avoid overfitting.

* when data is large, attention has a better performance. Cnn is good for less data.
* to do: how to reduce the memory of transformer [*Efficient Transformer: A survey*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.06732)
